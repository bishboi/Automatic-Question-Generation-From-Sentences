I do almost everything in python (3.7.1)

_NLTK_
-already downloaded in python3 using pip3
just write a python script initializing with 'import nltk' and 'from nltk import *' 

_StanfordNLP_
-To use use StanfordNLP it is built in java , to use it in python, Ive set up a virtual environment using miniconda to initiate the environment(using conda create -n stanfordnlp python=3.7.1 ') just type 'source activate stanfordnlp' (works only in bash shell)
Ive already downloaded SNLP(400 MB) but to download English pack(1.9 GB), I need a LAN. 
However, the java version is already there in linguistics folder. 

_Spacy_
Already set up, just need to import spacy and all modules from spacy when using in python.

_OpenSesame_
readme on github , I still dont know how to train the program
